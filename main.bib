Localization, obstacle detection and avoidance and control loop are the three main part of an UAV along with hardware and computer vision based algorithms. In UAV and other autonomus vehicle, GPS is one of the primary component for localization, though it has some drawback if the signal is not received correctly and there are other methods combined with GPS reducing the error such as INS, EKS, Vision based algorithms e.g. VSLAM, VO, SLAM etc. There are various VS algorithm proposed for inner loop controlling such as fuzzy controller and cooperative mapping control and security and surveillance is one of the important factor building up a self controlling UAVs. For refuiling, researchers had been proposed techniques such as AAR which has two different segments and a machine learning approach which uses HSV color for improving accuracy and inspection is another feature in recent years.

This paper aims at providing a comprehensive survey of the recent progress on computer vision algorithms and their corresponding hardware implementations. In particular, the prominent achievements in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection and image segmentation brought by deep learning techniques are highlighted. On the other hand, review of techniques for implementing and optimizing deep-learning-based computer vision algorithms on GPU, FPGA and other new generations of hardware accelerators are presented to facilitate real-time and/or energy-efficient operations. Finally, several promising directions for future research are presented to motivate further development in the field.},

There are many algorithm for computer vision and need a huge hardware requirement due to heavy workload. Image classification which has a numerous algorithm consist of multi-layer, activation function, ReLU and pooling layer counting up to 190 layers and process up to 60 million parameters such as DenseNet has an accuracy of 79.2\%. Detecting object is costly  due to its localization. The first one stage object detection method(YOLO) can reach to 45 FPS. Image segmentation relates the actual orientation in a plane and extensively determined by pixel. For accuracy improvement, CRF can be applied with the output which includes contextual knowledge. Other than CPU, GPU is now widely used in parallel computing for professional and experimental purpose such as Tital V4 started in 2007 after NVIDIA released CUDA. CNN algorithm can be run under parallel process by changing the traditional steps. FPGAs plays when it comes to IoT devices and has friendly re-programmable facilities such as Arial 10 has a 90\% accuracy with over 138 million parameters. There are some application specific hardware which is a mixture of CPUs, GPUs such as TPU designed for neural network. There are lots of scope to be done for optimization on algorithm along with hardware which will unify everything and compact with usecases.
